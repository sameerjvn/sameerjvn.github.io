Hello! I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. I build scalable AI systems and dig into the internals of deep learning models.

I'm currently working at Ericsson, where I develop AI automation systems to simplify the production of embedded software for [Ericsson radios](https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/networks/ericsson-radio-system).

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at OneConvergence, developing [DKube](https://www.dkube.io/), an MLOps platform to simplify data science workflows.

I completed my [MSc. in Complex Adaptive Systems](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/complex-adaptive-systems-msc/) at Chalmers University of Technology. My master's thesis at [Zenseact AB](https://zenseact.com/) focused on improving vehicle localization using deep learning. Here's the report if you're curious: [SD Map Localization: A Deep Learning Approach](https://odr.chalmers.se/server/api/core/bitstreams/5e4a60e5-0f58-48df-ac92-d3cc983b51dc/content).

I like going under the hood of deep learning models. I'd like to learn more about GPUs and performance optimization, and I'm currently playing around with [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad).
