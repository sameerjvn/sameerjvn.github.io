# Understanding nanochat

This is a live document where I note down my experiences while working on [Andrej Karpathy's nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat). My primary goal is somewhat vain: I just need to understand it enough to contribute some code to the source repo and have my name in the list of the contributors :)
